# Critters

I have an idea to create a cellular automata-based game. 

Let's imagine that we're inspired by something akin to the "autoverse" from "Permutation City" by Greg Egan. 

I've chosen a rule for this: it's called Critters (you can just Google it). This automaton is reversible and upholds the cell-conservation law.

Initially, we need a tool to explore and classify potential effects and configurations within this automaton. I've already created something along these lines, primarily to familiarize myself with Angular.

Next, we need gameplay. For that, we require creative concepts. 

We could introduce a hero in this world, who is also a cell. This hero has the ability to reconfigure cells within a nearby area and possesses a buffer of cells. 
By reconfiguring cells in his vicinity, the hero can induce movement, generate "bullets", and gather cells from the surrounding environment.
Cells, or specific configurations of them (dense configurations perhaps?), serve as resources in this world. The hero can accumulate these resources and fortify them with walls made from sparse cells confugurations, which are challenging to destroy in Critters automata.
In addition to the hero, we can introduce programmed mobs which could handle tasks like resource gathering or attack opposing constructions. 
We'll need a mechanism for cell privatization as well.

In conclusion, this could culminate in a hybrid game, combining elements of Minecraft and Warcraft within a cellular world.
